# Thesis-Project

	The process of buying or selling a car can be confusing for consumers as well as experienced tradespeople. 
  This project aimed to address this issue by developing a car valuation tool that provided up to date price 
  estimates and breakdowns. This required the development of a web scraper using Python, a database using 
  MySQL, an API using PHP and a User Interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The completed solution allows 
  users to view detailed price breakdowns for any car available on the Donedeal online marketplace, suggests 
  cars that they may be interested in, and allows them to create an account for saving searches for easier 
  future viewing. In doing this the site makes use of the Google Charts JavaScript API, the Google Maps 
  JavaScript API, and Infinite Developmentsâ€™ CarImagery API.
